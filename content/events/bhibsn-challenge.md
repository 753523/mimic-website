# Announcing the 2018 BHI & BSN Data Challenge

In collaboration with the IEEE Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI) 2018 and the IEEE Conference on Body Sensor Networks (BSN), we are hosting a challenge to explore real clinical questions in critically ill patients using the MIMIC-III database. Winners of the competition will be invited the present at the BHI & BSN Annual Conference in Las Vegas, USA (4-7 March 2018): https://bhi-bsn.embs.org/2018/

## What are the prizes?

TBC

## What is the timeline?

The Challenge is now open! Participating teams have one month to carry out a research project using the MIMIC-III database. Final papers must be submitted for consideration by midnight (PST) on **5 March 2018**.

- Challenge announced: 5 February 2018
- Deadline for registration of teams: 1 March 2018
- Deadline for final paper submission: 5 March 2018
- Awards and presentations by selected participants: 7 March 2018 

## How can I enter the challenge?

The BHI & BSN Data Challenge asks participants to carry out a retrospective study using the MIMIC-III Database. This year's research question is focused on a controversial and important logistical issue hospitals encounter every week: Are patients admitted to the intensive care unit on a weekend more likely to die in the hospital than those admitted on a weekday? 

Team must register for the challenge using the following form before midnight (PST) on **1 March 2018**. Challenge entries must be submitted in the form of a research paper before midnight (PST) on **5 March 2018**. Guidelines for formatting the paper are available at: XXX.

<!-- Explain why we have selected this challenge. Aim is to introduce people to working with MIMIC-III; interested in seeing diversity approaches to look at similar question; seek to reinforce good practice in retrospective research. -->

## Who is eligibile?

Anyone with an interest in the reuse of routinely collected clinical data to improve healthcare is invited to participate. We encourage the formation of teams with participants of different backgrounds, including for example data analysts, statisticians, caregivers, and patients. 

At least one member of a team should be registed to attend the [BHI & BSN Annual Conference](https://bhi-bsn.embs.org/2018/) in Las Vegas, USA 4-7 March 2018 because winning teams will be invited to give a short presentation at the event on **7 March 2018**.

## How can I access the challenge data?

Participants will use the MIMIC-III database, which comprises routinely collected data for critical care patients for over 50,000 hospital stays. There is a formal process for requesting access to MIMIC-III, which is described at: https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/

Gaining access to the full MIMIC-III dataset may take several days, so we suggest using the MIMIC-III demo while waiting to gain full access: https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/demo/

## How are entries assessed?

Project entries will be assessed by a judging panel on the following criteria:

- Reproducibility: How easily can the study results be reproduced? (e.g. consider code availability; clear cohort selection critera, etc)
- TBC

## The challenge

## Data for the challenge

Participants will be using the MIMIC-III database for the challenge, which comprises routinely collected data for critical care patients for over 50,000 hospital stays. There is a formal process for requesting access to MIMIC-III, which is described at: https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/

Gaining access to the full MIMIC-III dataset may take several days, so we suggest using the MIMIC-III demo while waiting to gain full access: https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/demo/

# Announcing the 2018 BHI & BSN Data Challenge

In collaboration with the IEEE Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI) 2018 and the IEEE Conference on Body Sensor Networks (BSN), we are hosting a challenge to explore real clinical questions in critically ill patients using the MIMIC-III database. Participants in the challenge will be invited the present at the BHI & BSN Annual Conference in Las Vegas, USA (4-7 March 2018): https://bhi-bsn.embs.org/2018/

## What are the prizes?

TBC

## What is the timeline?

The Challenge is now open for registration! Participating teams have one month to carry out a research project using the MIMIC-III database. Final submissions must be sent for consideration by noon (PST) on **6 March 2018**. 

- Challenge announced: 5 February 2018
- Deadline for registration of teams: 1 March 2018 or as space permits
- Deadline for final submission: 6 March 2018 (noon PST)
- Awards and presentations by selected participants: 7 March 2018 (sessions TBC)

## Who is eligible?

Anyone with an interest in the reuse of routinely collected clinical data to improve healthcare is invited to participate. This is an opportunity for participants to learn about the benefits and challenges of working with complex healthcare data.  

While individual submissions are welcomed, we encourage the formation of teams with participants of different backgrounds. Often successful projects consider a broad range of perspectives, including for example the data scientist, statistician, carer, and patient.

At least one member of a team must be able to attend the [BHI & BSN Annual Conference](https://bhi-bsn.embs.org/2018/) in Las Vegas, USA 4-7 March 2018 to give a short presentation at the event on **7 March 2018**.  Registration at the conference is _not_ a requirement, and not all team members need be present. 

## How can I enter the challenge?

The BHI & BSN Data Challenge asks participants to carry out a retrospective study using the MIMIC-III Database. This year's research question is focused on a controversial and important logistical issue hospitals encounter every week:

_Are patients admitted to the intensive care unit on a weekend more likely to die in the hospital than those admitted on a weekday?_

Team must register for the challenge using the following form before midnight (PST) on **1 March 2018**. Challenge entries must be submitted in the form of a 7-minute research presentation before noon (PST) on **6 March 2018**. Guidelines for formatting the presentations are available at: TBC.

<!-- Explain why we have selected this challenge. Aim is to introduce people to working with MIMIC-III; interested in seeing diversity approaches to look at similar question; seek to reinforce good practice in retrospective research. -->

See our registration checklist below for the steps required for a team to enter the challenge.

## How can I access the challenge data?

Participants will use the MIMIC-III database, which comprises routinely collected data for critical care patients for over 50,000 hospital stays. There is a formal process for requesting access to MIMIC-III, which is described at: https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/

Gaining access to the full MIMIC-III dataset may take several days, so we suggest using the MIMIC-III demo while waiting to gain full access: https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/demo/

## How are entries assessed?

Project entries will be assessed by a judging panel on the following criteria:

- Reproducibility  
- Scientific methods  
- Presentation  
- Novelty  

## Registration checklist

1. Register your team using this form []  
2. Get access to the data by following the instructions at: https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/  
  - Participants should complete [human subjects ethics training](https://www.citiprogram.org/index.cfm?pageID=154&icat=0&ac=0). Select 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affiliates' as your organization affiliation. 
  - Participants need to agree to the MIMIC III data use agreement.  
  - Participants need to download the MIMIC-III dataset.
3. Mark your calendar for the presentation session at the [BHI & BSN Annual Conference](https://bhi-bsn.embs.org/2018/) in Las Vegas on 7 March 2018.

## Submission checklist

1. Prepare your slides in PDF or PPT format:  
  - Presentations will be allotted at most 7 minutes.  
  - Presentations must include: methodology, results and conclusions.  
2. Is your project reproducible?  
  - Is your code available?  
  - Could someone replicate your study cohort and analysis easily?  
  - Have you clearly cited your data sources?  
3. Have you practiced and timed your presentation? The presentation should be no more than 7 minutes.  
4. Have you emailed your presentation to the challenge organizers at `data-challenge.physionet.org`? Deadline: 6 March 2018 (noon PST).  
5. Please arrive the conference room of the presentation session at least 15 minutes in advance of the start of the session and introduce yourself to the session chair.

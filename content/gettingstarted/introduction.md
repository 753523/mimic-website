# MIMIC

MIMIC is a large, openly available database sourced from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). The data collected centers around the intensive care unit (ICU), an area of the hospital which cares for the acutely ill patients. Due to the high level of monitoring of ICU patients, a large amount of information is documented in the electronic data magement system. This information has been made available to the public in the hopes that it can provide further insight into clinical care.

# MIMIC III

The latest version of MIMIC is MIMIC III v1.0 consisting of nearly 58,000 hospital admissions corresponding to over 48,000 distinct patients. The data spans June 2001 - October 2012. MIMIC II contained ICU clinical data from 2001 to 2008; MIMIC II extends the data set to October of 2012 by integrating two ICU databases.
